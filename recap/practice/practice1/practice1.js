/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////points to recap on
create new object
with multi keys
arrow function key that declares a variable
this function is a constructor
two word keys


console.log

function that has this.variable
call that sum outside
strict mode

switch case=
give case input, case this input change something=



access the object keys from outside=
update using the assign method=
based on the received word+ "wordkey"=

pass to a key-function an argument=
give that constructor a custom prototype method=
make a new instance of the constructor and use the method on=
give parameters using spread args=

merge the object with another object using the spread syntax=
copy an array into another array format with concatenate using spread=
//merging objects separate using the spread syntax


output the keys of the object=
output each key separately using for let with checking if it is it's property=

use map to change an array into a new array=
copy this array using slice or spread=

convert that object into json


(1) design the script
(2) design the layout kp



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////points organized to build a pseudo code on
create a new object
with multi keys
"arrow constructor" function key that declares variables named with two words


give the "arrow constructor" custom prototype methods=
that assign new keys to the object using assign=
or merge this object with another object using spread=
or merge a key-array in between another array using a provided location after knowing the array length (employees)=
or output the keys of the object (an array) and store into a keys-key
or output each key separately=

make new instances of the "arrow constructor"=
where you pass parameters using spread=

copy the employees array to another new object's key-array using slice or spread
use map to increase salaries key=


switch case that adds name to access the needed custom method

merge all departments objects (combined)=



make it intuitive



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////application pseudo code

let us say you have 2 departments stored

let departmentOne = {

    //array of 3x single-employee objects
    levelOne: [ {name: , age: , position; salary: }],
    levelTwo: [ {name: , age: , position; salary: }],

    addaNewLevelfunction


}

let departmentTwo = {

    //array of 3x single-employee objects
    levelOne: [ {name: , age: , position; salary: }]
    levelTwo: [ {name: , age: , position; salary: }]


}

//employee constructor, 
custom method to view details using for let/in
custom method to add a detail with a value using defineProperty
increaseSalaryOfAnEmployee: function () {
    //this will take an employee and update his salary index
},
changePositionOfAnEmployee: function () {
    //this will access the employee's position and change it by the input requested
}
changeLocationOfAnEmployee:
    //this will display the departments and ask for a department
    //this will display the levels and ask for a level
    //this will display the desks(array index) and ask for a desk(array index)
    //this will remove the employee from the previous location

removeEmployee (same as) changeLocationOfAnEmployee:
    //x this will display the departments and ask for a department
    //x this will display the levels and ask for a level
    //x this will display the desks(array index) and ask for a desk(array index)
    // this will remove the employee from the previous location


//also would need an action object

let actionObject = {

    mergeAlldepartmentsObjectsSeparateKeys: function () {
        //combine department objects using spread ...arg
    },

    mergeAlldepartmentsObjectsCombined: function () {
    //combine department objects using spread ...arg
    },

    increaseAllSalaries: 
        //receive all salaries
        //map to increase the salaries
        //put back

    displayAllDepartments
        //using object.keys

    addNewEmployee (same as) changeLocationOfAnEmployee:
        //this will display the departments and ask for a department
        //this will display the levels and ask for a level
        //this will display the desks(array index) and ask for a desk(array index)
        //x this will remove the employee from the previous location

    displayAllEmployees
        //

    displayEmployee
        //this will ask for the name/code provided from displayAllEmployees
        //and provide info using the employee constructor method

}


//the layout
//let us begin with a table of three cols
//col1: buttons
//col2: the console
//col3: all employees within the departments

//button to store the code/object database in a file using node.js
