//////(Day15)

using media queries in challenge 3 of part 2


place media queries at the bottom so they can overwrite things

.main-container > .flex-row  {
    display: block;
}

.conatainer2-side1, .conatainer2-side2, .container-1-text-wrapper-col, .container-1-image-container-col {
    width: 100%;
}


//breakpoints
when my layout starts to fail
keep the bp to min for the css code to be easier to maintain

phone, tablet,  tab landscape, desktop, big desktop
600px, 900px, 1200px, and 1800px,+

generally the smallest devices are 320px

the less breakpoints you have, the easier it is to maintain them

//////(Day16)

html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
//makes the website responsive and not show desktop view on mobile phones


//font in the body is mainly for p's, the main content of the document
//and then can overwrite later on headers etc.
body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 
    font-size:
}

try plain html without any css on mobile mode, it is already responsive
then work from mobile to desktop in css
moving from section to section
for <section> added padding: 4em 0;
for <container-wrap> added width 85%, margin 0 auto, max-width: 1120px;

its simpler there because most of the edits will be for the colors,fonts etc
then on larger sizes handle the layout using media queries

avoid texts that going all the way across in larger sizes
use responsive mode to check on breakpoints on text spread size
starting around 600-800px

as we are working from mobile up will use min width
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    row {
        display: row
    }
}


in html, lorem + tab, lorem100 + tab (100 words) emmet

/* the order you put things in is important //
here 400 will apply till only 500 then 500 will take over
however because the .box is stated after, 
it will take over the two media queries above*/
@media (min-width: 400px) {

    .box {
        background-color: #87629A;
    }

}

@media (min-width: 500px) {

    .box {
        background-color: #cd91ec;
    }

}

.box {
    background-color: #23424A ;
    width: 90%;
    padding: 10em 0;
    margin: 5em auto;
}



/* 600px or bigger, size between 600 and 900
@media (min-width: 600px) and 
(max-width:900px) {

    .box {
        background-color: #136C72;
    }

}

/* 600px or smaller
@media (max-width: 600px) {

    .box {
        background-color: #87629A;
    }
