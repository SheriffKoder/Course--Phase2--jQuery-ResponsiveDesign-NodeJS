changing content without reloading js

fetch content from other sites, API's
how to validate forms on your site, 

more frameworks: advanced : mootools, Dojo toolkit
Yahoo YUI, underscore js (basic), angular, backbone, amberjs

jq has more on site documentation, huge users support

that works across multitude of browsers
